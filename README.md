mongobook is an address book application primarily used as a means to evaluate
bootstrap for layout and experiment with various backend solutions for a simple app.

###Features
Built on a custom coded node.js server running with express and mongodb for data storage.  A custom library for server template value caching and common mongodb tasks serves as the server side controller for the application.  On the client side, views are rendered using handlebars templates with simple caching.
